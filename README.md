Work Day Scheduler :
a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.
we can see :
* current day at the top of the calender.
* timeblocks for standard business hours.
* timeblock color is based on past, present, and future.
* user can  enter an event when click a timeblock.

-The JavaScript code uses jQuery and Day.js to dynamically generate timeblocks, color-code them based on the current time.
-The timeblocks are created for standard business hours (9AM to 5PM).
